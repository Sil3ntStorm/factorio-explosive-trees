Version: 0.6
Date: 2024-06-22

  Features:
    - Added explosions to rocks.
    - Added explosions to vehicles.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.5.1163
Date: 2022-07-30

  BugFixes:
    - Fixed a (seemingly) rare error that would cause to be thrown to main menu.

  Changes:
    - Disable fire triggering new explosions by default, due to the inefficient
      nature of the necessary activity to detect it causing slowdown and low
      UPS, especially on multiplayer. Can be enabled via mod setting. Maybe I
      will find a better way to do this eventually.

  Features:
    - Added slowdown capsules
    - Added distractor capsules

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.3.1159
Date: 2022-05-15

  Features:
    - Added options to configure chance for each possible action to happen, including
      disabling certain actions from happening at all.
    - Added options to specify the maximum number of each action that can happen for
      every tree that triggers.
    - Added destroyer capsules

  BugFixes:
    - Fixed a potential desync issue in multiplayer which could happen after a nuke or
      poison cloud got triggered, a new player joined and another tree explosion got
      triggered within the first 200 ticks (or whatever was configured for nuke / poison
      delays) of the player joining (#1)

  Changes:
    - Changed early game safety time to be specified in minutes instead of ticks (#3)
    - Changed nuke and poison delay to be specified in seconds rather than ticks (#3)
    - Changed a few descriptions to hopefully better explain a few settings (#2)
