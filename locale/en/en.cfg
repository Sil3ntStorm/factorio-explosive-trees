[mod-setting-description]
set-tree-explosion-chance-harvest=Chance of Trees causing explosive side effects when harvested.
set-tree-explosion-chance-damage=Chance of Trees exploding when damaged. Higher values (over ~30) can have a huge negative impact on memory usage (32+ GB) and performance (<1 UPS) especially in larger dense forests.
set-extra-explosions-chance=For non nuclear explosions, this specifies the chance for additional explosions to be triggered.
set-nuke-delay=Number of ticks to not spawn new nuclear explosions after the last one was triggered. The game does really, really bad with anything over a handful of nuclear explosions to calculate. Default is 200 which pretty much guarantees that only one nuclear explosion is triggered at a given time, after this the first explosion should have completed.
set-poison-delay=Number of ticks to not spawn new poison clouds after the last one was triggered. The game performance tends to degenerate quickly when too many of them are present at a time. Lower value => more concurrent poison clouds and lower UPS.
set-enable-nuke=Enables trees exploding with the force of a nuclear bomb.
set-require-research=Tree explosions have a chance to become stronger as you research more things. Gates certain explosions behind their relevant research (e.g. nuclear explosions only happen after researching nuclear things).
set-peaceful-ticks=Number of ticks that trees do not explode at the start of the game
