[mod-setting-description]
set-tree-explosion-chance-harvest=Chance of Trees causing explosive side effects when harvested. You will still get the wood, but might be hurt (or die) in the process and be forced to recover your corpse to receive the wood.
set-tree-explosion-chance-damage=Chance of Trees exploding when damaged. When trees get damaged enough in any way, shape or form (including poison gas and other explosions triggered by this mod), this specifies the chance of the damaged tree exploding. This can lead to chain reactions wiping out entire forests (which IS a desired effect). Higher values (over ~30) can have a huge negative impact on memory usage (32+ GB) and performance (<1 UPS) especially in larger dense forests. Values below 5 should be safe and will usually stop mid forest as well.
set-extra-explosions-chance=Specifies the chance for additional explosions to be triggered. Each additional explosion (configurable below per action type) will have this chance to actually happen.
set-nuke-delays=Number of seconds to not spawn new nuclear explosions after the last one was triggered. The game does really, really bad with anything over a handful of nuclear explosions to calculate. Default is 3.33 which pretty much guarantees that only one nuclear explosion is triggered at a given time, as the first explosion animation should have completed.
set-poison-delays=Number of seconds to not spawn new poison clouds after the last one was triggered. The game performance tends to degenerate quickly when too many of them are present at a time. Lower value => more concurrent poison clouds and lower UPS.
set-enable-nuke=Enables trees exploding with the force of a nuclear bomb.
set-require-research=Tree explosions have a chance to become stronger as you research more things. Gates certain explosions behind their relevant research (e.g. nuclear explosions only happen after researching nuclear things).
set-peaceful-minutes=Number of minutes that trees do not explode at the start of the game. Recommended values are 10 - 60. The trees are supposed to increase in viciousness as you progress in the game and research more things.
set-weight-fire=Weighted chance. If all weighted chances are the same (the default), all of them have the same chance to happen. Lower or raise any one of them in relation to the others in order to increase / decrease the chance for a particular outcome. Set to 0 to disable this effect from being triggered at all. At least one effect has to be enabled.
set-weight-grenade=Weighted chance. If all weighted chances are the same (the default), all of them have the same chance to happen. Lower or raise any one of them in relation to the others in order to increase / decrease the chance for a particular outcome. Set to 0 to disable this effect from being triggered at all. At least one effect has to be enabled.
set-weight-cluster=Weighted chance. If all weighted chances are the same (the default), all of them have the same chance to happen. Lower or raise any one of them in relation to the others in order to increase / decrease the chance for a particular outcome. Set to 0 to disable this effect from being triggered at all. At least one effect has to be enabled.
set-weight-rocket=Weighted chance. If all weighted chances are the same (the default), all of them have the same chance to happen. Lower or raise any one of them in relation to the others in order to increase / decrease the chance for a particular outcome. Set to 0 to disable this effect from being triggered at all. At least one effect has to be enabled.
set-weight-arty=Weighted chance. If all weighted chances are the same (the default), all of them have the same chance to happen. Lower or raise any one of them in relation to the others in order to increase / decrease the chance for a particular outcome. Set to 0 to disable this effect from being triggered at all. At least one effect has to be enabled.
set-weight-poison=Weighted chance. If all weighted chances are the same (the default), all of them have the same chance to happen. Lower or raise any one of them in relation to the others in order to increase / decrease the chance for a particular outcome. Set to 0 to disable this effect from being triggered at all. At least one effect has to be enabled.
set-weight-destroyer=Weighted chance. If all weighted chances are the same (the default), all of them have the same chance to happen. Lower or raise any one of them in relation to the others in order to increase / decrease the chance for a particular outcome. Set to 0 to disable this effect from being triggered at all. At least one effect has to be enabled.
set-weight-nuke=Weighted chance. If all weighted chances are the same (the default), all of them have the same chance to happen. Lower or raise any one of them in relation to the others in order to increase / decrease the chance for a particular outcome. Set to 0 to disable this effect from being triggered at all. At least one effect has to be enabled.
set-count-fire=Maximum amount to spawns on tree death. If greater than 1, the additional explosive chance is used to determine whether an explosion happens or not. To disable this type use the weighted chance option for it.
set-count-grenade=Maximum amount to spawns on tree death. If greater than 1, the additional explosive chance is used to determine whether an explosion happens or not. To disable this type use the weighted chance option for it.
set-count-cluster=Maximum amount to spawns on tree death. If greater than 1, the additional explosive chance is used to determine whether an explosion happens or not. To disable this type use the weighted chance option for it.
set-count-rocket=Maximum amount to spawns on tree death. If greater than 1, the additional explosive chance is used to determine whether an explosion happens or not. To disable this type use the weighted chance option for it.
set-count-arty=Maximum amount to spawns on tree death. If greater than 1, the additional explosive chance is used to determine whether an explosion happens or not. To disable this type use the weighted chance option for it.
set-count-poison=Maximum amount to spawns on tree death. If greater than 1, the additional explosive chance is used to determine whether an explosion happens or not. To disable this type use the weighted chance option for it.
set-count-destroyer=Maximum amount to spawns on tree death. If greater than 1, the additional explosive chance is used to determine whether an explosion happens or not. To disable this type use the weighted chance option for it.
set-count-nuke=Maximum amount to spawns on tree death. If greater than 1, the additional explosive chance is used to determine whether an explosion happens or not. To disable this type use the weighted chance option for it.
